# DSC_Resilience

## R Simulation Script

This repository contains an R script used to generate the simulation results and figures presented in the paper “On the Resilience of the End-to-End Digital Supply Chain.”

The script is organized in three main parts. 
The first part implements the proposed mathematical model. The second part performs the simulation by generating synthetic data, while the third part  focuses on producing the corresponding plots used for analysis and visualization in the paper.

## Usage
For optimal visual rendering, the script should be executed within the RStudio environment.
